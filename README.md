# network-app 
A twitter-like social media app for mobile platforms built with react native and expo. The project is not finished and more features will be implemented soon (Some features under how it works section have not been implemented yet). 

# How it works 
Users can do almost anything that they do everyday with social media apps they use everyday. After logging in, users can display feeds shared by whoever they follow. They can create new posts to express their feelings and send messages to other people or share a comment on other posts. 

# Testing 
This app sends requests to the backend server in order to handle data. You'll get an error (network request failed) when testing this app using your local development server. Please head over to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33704130/react-native-android-fetch-failing-on-connection-to-local-api to see what you need to do to make it work. After that run the commands below after navigating into backend and network folders seperately. 
- run `npm install` to install dependencies 
- run `npm start` to start a local development server
